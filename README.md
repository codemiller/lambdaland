Making Code More Functional: Lambda Land in Layperson's Language
Linux.conf.au Presentation

Abstract: Functional programming (FP) has escaped from the ivory tower and is rising in popularity with software developers around the world. This presentation explains some of the reasons for the buzz around FP and attempts to demystify a few of the paradigm's esoteric terms. It will include examples of how FP techniques can be applied in a variety of open source programming languages that are not traditionally considered functional, including Java, Python and Perl. The aim of the presentation is to give every developer a few techniques they can apply, no matter what language they code in.
